# TradeFlow Bot

A modular crypto trading framework for live trading and backtesting, powered by the Binance API.  
Includes strategies such as RSI, MACD, and SMA crossover, with built-in risk management tools.

## Features
- Live trading with Binance API (REST + WebSocket)
- Backtesting engine with performance metrics (PnL, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns)
- Risk management (position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit)
- Modular strategy design – plug in your own algorithms easily
- Dockerized deployment for production-like environments

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradeflow-bot.git
   cd tradeflow-bot
````

2. Add API keys
   Edit `config.py` with your Binance API key and secret.

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run live trading

   ```bash
   python rsi_bot.py
   ```

5. Run backtests

   ```bash
   python backtest.py
   ```

## Example Workflow

* Subscribe to real-time candlestick data via WebSocket
* Run your chosen strategy (e.g., RSI > 70 → Sell, RSI < 30 → Buy)
* Apply risk rules (stop-loss, position sizing)
* Place orders via Binance REST API or simulate via backtesting

## Roadmap

Planned improvements and future features:

* Multi-exchange support (Kraken, Coinbase, etc.)
* Portfolio tracking and performance dashboards
* Additional strategies (Bollinger Bands, VWAP, momentum-based)
* Improved backtester with historical tick-level data
* Machine learning–driven signal generation

This way your repo looks **polished and ambitious**, while still making it clear it’s **your own framework** and not just a fork.  

👉 Want me to also help you draft a **sample strategy file** (like `sma_crossover.py`) so your repo already looks “feature-rich” out of the box?
