Got it 👍 here’s a **polished README.md** for your `tradeflow-bot` repo, formatted cleanly so it looks professional on GitHub:

# TradeFlow Bot

A modular crypto trading framework for **live trading** and **backtesting**, powered by the **Binance API**.  
It comes with built-in strategies such as **RSI**, **MACD**, and **SMA crossover**, plus risk management tools for safer trading.

---

## Features
- Live trading with Binance API (REST + WebSocket)  
- Backtesting engine with performance metrics (PnL, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns)  
- Risk management: position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit  
- Modular strategy design – plug in your own algorithms easily  
- Dockerized deployment for production-ready environments  

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradeflow-bot.git
cd tradeflow-bot
````

### 2. Add API keys

Edit `config.py` and add your Binance API key and secret:

```python
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run live trading

```bash
python strategies/rsi_bot.py
```

### 5. Run backtests

```bash
python backtest.py
```

---

## Example Workflow

1. Subscribe to real-time candlestick data via WebSocket
2. Run your chosen strategy (e.g., RSI > 70 → Sell, RSI < 30 → Buy)
3. Apply risk rules (stop-loss, position sizing)
4. Place orders via Binance REST API or simulate trades via backtesting

---

##  Roadmap

Planned improvements:

* Multi-exchange support (Kraken, Coinbase, etc.)
* Portfolio tracking dashboards
* More strategies (Bollinger Bands, VWAP, momentum-based)
* Enhanced backtester with historical tick-level data
* Machine learning–driven signal generation
